# Students Management Application

This project represents a student management application designed by CRUD philosophy. It can execute several actions against the DB ‚Äì add, retrieve, update, and delete student details.

## Features 
- Management of two main DBs: 
  1. DB for the student management app
  2. DB that documents every path and method that have been used by the client (activated automatically).
- Two optional run modes: HTML & JSON 
- Client application (only in JSON mode) ‚Äì this app reads a provided text file which include one of the CRUD commands. Then the app commits the specific command.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Run mode HTML:
```bash
npm run start
```
Run mode JSON:
```bash
npm start [--json]
```
Note: in order to activate the client app you must run "node client.js" in separate terminal.
